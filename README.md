A Hybrid Capsule Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification

A novel end-to-end DL architecture, namely the Hybrid Capsule Network (HCapsNet), is presented for HSI classification. HCapsNet employs 2D and 3D CNNs to improve the architecture to extract higher-level spatial and spectral features. To establish a route between capsules in the lower layers and the most-related capsule in the higher layer, dynamic routing (DR) is used to identify several overlapped objects during training sessions. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using nested cross-validation (Nested-CV) to ensure thorough generalisation evaluation. The proposed HCapsNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall classification accuracy in the Hyperspectral Imaging (HI) area.
